### SQL-in-Pythonic-way-via-Jupyter

I have covered a few basics of SQL on Jupyter Notebook by connecting MySQL DB with python.
Different Joins are covered by creating small tables for clear visualization. An interesting part may be that, 
first Pandas merge is used for joining and then equivalent operation is carried out using SQL joins. 
In the end, Few practice questions are solved based on Chinook Data.
One can find many questions on the net for further practice on chinook data. 
Concept covered:
1) Selecting data from the table
2) Creating, updating, Deleting the table
3) Creating a temporary table
4) Filtering, Sorting
5) Using wildcard
6) Math operations
7) Aggregation and Groupby
8) Where Vs Having
9) Joins(Inner, Left, Right, Outer, Self)
10) Many more & Practice Problems on Chinook database
* The importance of SQL in the data science domain  motivates me to compile this quick SQL Starter Notebook: SQL-in-Pythonic-way-via-Jupyter
